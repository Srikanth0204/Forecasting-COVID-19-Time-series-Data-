What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a new virus. Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat and shortness of breath. The virus can spread from person to person, but good hygiene can prevent infection.

Related Information about COVID-19
COVID-19 may not be fatal but it spreads faster than other diseases, like common cold. Every virus has Basic Reproduction number (R0) which implies how many people will get the disease from the infected person. As per inital reseach work R0 of COVID-19 is 2.7.

Currently the goal of all scientists around the world is to "Flatten the Curve". COVID-19 currently has exponential growth rate around the world which we will be seeing in the notebook ahead. Flattening the Curve typically implies even if the number of Confirmed Cases are increasing but the distribution of those cases should be over longer timestamp. To put it in simple words if say suppose COVID-19 is going infect 100K people then those many people should be infected in 1 year but not in a month.

The sole reason to Flatten the Curve is to reudce the load on the Medical Systems so as to increase the focus of Research to find the Medicine for the disease.

Every Pandemic has four stages:

Stage 1: Confirmed Cases come from other countries

Stage 2: Local Transmission Begins

Stage 3: Communities impacted with local transimission

Stage 4: Significant Transmission with no end in sight

Italy, USA, UK and France are the two countries which are currently in Stage 4 While India is in on the edge of Stage 3.

Other ways to tackle the disease like Corona other than Travel Ban, Cross-Border shutdown, Ban on immigrants are Testing, Contact Tracing and Quarantine.

Objective of the Notebook
Objective of this notebook is to study COVID-19 outbreak with the help of some basic visualizations techniques. Comparison of China where the COVID-19 originally originated from with the Rest of the World. Perform predictions and Time Series forecasting in order to study the impact and spread of the COVID-19 in comming days.
